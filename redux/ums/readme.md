## ums
Stands for **U**ser **M**anagement **S**ystem.

## Tools of the Trade

- Redux v1.0
- React v0.14
- classnames
- browserify
- Babel


## Notes

- This was written before `v1.0` was released.
- The [**Smart and Dumb Components**](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) concept introduced by *Dan Abramov* (@gaearon), author of [Redux](github.com/rackt/redux), is a pretty nice idea. I've thought of similar ideas, but never a concrete one.
- Although not limited to Redux, selectors are awesome. Again, had similar ideas, but never a concrete one.
- Redux has a very simple and convenient API. Awesome, really. All's left is async workflow and try it on a larger scale.
