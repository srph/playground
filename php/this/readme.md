## this
Check if `this` works similary to JS. Haha.

#### file.php
- Nope, not JS-ey at all.

#### index.php
- Assigning an object property to a closure doesn't work. PHP thinks you're calling (as a function) a property.
- Assigning the assigned closure to a variable doesn't work either.

Anyway, just check the source code. They're basic behaviors. I merely checked if my assumptions about stupid details were correct.
